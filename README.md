# 🌟 Convert a Word Doc to html

## 🚀 Quick Start with uvx

The easiest way to run word2html without installing is using `uvx`:

    uvx word2html /path/to/MyGloriousDoc.docx

This will give you a new file, `/path/to/MyGloriousDoc.html`, that's (hopefully)
decent-looking html.

## 💾 Installation

To install with uv:

    uv tool install word2html

Or with pip:

    pip install word2html

Then run:

    word2html /path/to/MyGloriousDoc.docx

## ⭐ Star History

This project _really_ started out as a joke -- although this is something I've done too many times. I'm always
amazed at how many people have starred this repo. 🤩
